# GitHub VSC

Use VSCode to edit GitHub repos, in your browser.

## How?

Change `github` to `github-vsc` in the URL and press Enter.

E.g. `github.com/gao-sun/eul` -> `github-vsc.com/gao-sun/eul`

## Highlights

- `Cmd + P` (quick navigation) support
- Global text search support (on the default branch)
- Document editing with GitHub commits (fork/commit/pull request)

## Credits

Heavily inspired by [github1s](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s), edited vscode compiling part from [vscode-web](https://github.com/Felx-B/vscode-web), and derivated FileSystem implementation from [vscode-web-playground](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-web-playground).
